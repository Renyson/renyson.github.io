This is a lightweight static blog scaffold generated by an assistant.

Quick start:

- Serve the site locally (from the project root):

	```bash
	python3 -m http.server 8000
	# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
	```

How it works:

- `index.html` is the single-page entry. It loads `posts/posts.json` to render the list of posts.
- Post content lives in `posts/<slug>.html` and is loaded on demand.
- Styles and client logic are in `assets/`.

To add a post:

1. Create `posts/<your-slug>.html` with your post content (use HTML fragments).
2. Add a JSON entry to `posts/posts.json` with `title`, `date`, `slug`, and `excerpt`.

Want a different setup (e.g., Jekyll, Hugo, Eleventy)? Tell me and I can scaffold that instead.
