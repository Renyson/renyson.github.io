# renyson.github.io

This is a lightweight static blog scaffold generated by an assistant.

Quick start:

- Serve the site locally (from the project root):

	```bash
	python3 -m http.server 8000
	# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
	```

How it works:

- `index.html` is the single-page entry. It loads `posts/posts.json` to render the list of posts.
- Post content lives in `posts/<slug>.html` and is loaded on demand.
- Styles and client logic are in `assets/`.

To add a post:

1. Create `posts/<your-slug>.html` with your post content (use HTML fragments).
2. Add a JSON entry to `posts/posts.json` with `title`, `date`, `slug`, and `excerpt`.

Want a different setup (e.g., Jekyll, Hugo, Eleventy)? Tell me and I can scaffold that instead.

Build system (Markdown -> static `dist/`)

This repo now includes a small Python builder that converts Markdown posts in `content/posts/` into a static `dist/` site.

Usage:

```bash
# install dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt --user

# build
python3 build.py

# serve the generated site
cd dist && python3 -m http.server 8000
```

The generated output is written to `dist/`. You can add Markdown posts to `content/posts/` (use YAML-style front matter) and rebuild.

RSS feed

- The builder now generates an RSS feed at `dist/rss.xml` (also suitable for GitHub Pages). It includes `title`, `link`, `description`, and `pubDate` where available.

SEO

- Templates (`templates/index.html`, `templates/post.html`) include basic meta description, canonical link, Open Graph, and Twitter cards. The values are derived from site metadata configured in `build.py` and each post's front matter (`excerpt`).

Sitemap

- The builder now also produces a `dist/sitemap.xml` (Sitemap XML 0.9) containing the site index and each post URL with `lastmod` where available. Ensure `SITE_URL` in `build.py` matches your published domain so the sitemap contains correct absolute URLs.
